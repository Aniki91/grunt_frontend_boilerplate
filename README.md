# Grunt Front-End Boilerplate

Grunt tasks for a Front-End workflow using LESS and SMACSS.

## Setup

1. Pull the latest repo code.
2. Navigate to the target directory.
3. Install all node dependencies with the following command:
```sh
npm install
```
4. Run this and you're good to go:
```sh
grunt watch
```

When a JS file is changed, all JS files will be concatenated and minified into one file.
When a LESS file is changed, all LESS files will be compiled into CSS, which will then be minified.

*Check out Gruntfile.js for a full list of grunt tasks.*
